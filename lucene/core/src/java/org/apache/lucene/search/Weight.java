/**
 * Expert: Calculate query weights and build query scorers.
 * <p>
 * The purpose of {@link Weight} is to ensure searching does not modify a
 * {@link Query}, so that a {@link Query} instance can be reused. <br>
 * {@link IndexSearcher} dependent state of the query should reside in the
 * {@link Weight}. <br>
 * {@link AtomicReader} dependent state should reside in the {@link Scorer}.
 * <p>
 * Since {@link Weight} creates {@link Scorer} instances for a given
 * {@link AtomicReaderContext} ({@link #scorer(AtomicReaderContext, 
 * PostingFeatures, Bits)})
 * callers must maintain the relationship between the searcher's top-level
 * {@link IndexReaderContext} and the context used to create a {@link Scorer}. 
 * <p>
 * A <code>Weight</code> is used in the following way:
 * <ol>
 * <li>A <code>Weight</code> is constructed by a top-level query, given a
 * <code>IndexSearcher</code> ({@link Query#createWeight(IndexSearcher)}).
 * <li>The {@link #getValueForNormalization()} method is called on the
 * <code>Weight</code> to compute the query normalization factor
 * {@link Similarity#queryNorm(float)} of the query clauses contained in the
 * query.
 * <li>The query normalization factor is passed to {@link #normalize(float, float)}. At
 * this point the weighting is complete.
 * <li>A <code>Scorer</code> is constructed by
 * {@link #scorer(AtomicReaderContext, PostingFeatures, Bits)}.
 * </ol>
