/**
 * This class accepts multiple added documents and directly
 * writes segment files.
 *
 * Each added document is passed to the {@link DocConsumer},
 * which in turn processes the document and interacts with
 * other consumers in the indexing chain.  Certain
 * consumers, like {@link StoredFieldsConsumer} and {@link
 * TermVectorsConsumer}, digest a document and
 * immediately write bytes to the "doc store" files (ie,
 * they do not consume RAM per document, except while they
 * are processing the document).
 *
 * Other consumers, eg {@link FreqProxTermsWriter} and
 * {@link NormsConsumer}, buffer bytes in RAM and flush only
 * when a new segment is produced.

 * Once we have used our allowed RAM buffer, or the number
 * of added docs is large enough (in the case we are
 * flushing by doc count instead of RAM usage), we create a
 * real segment and flush it to the Directory.
 *
 * Threads:
 *
 * Multiple threads are allowed into addDocument at once.
 * There is an initial synchronized call to getThreadState
 * which allocates a ThreadState for this thread.  The same
 * thread will get the same ThreadState over time (thread
 * affinity) so that if there are consistent patterns (for
 * example each thread is indexing a different content
 * source) then we make better use of RAM.  Then
 * processDocument is called on that ThreadState without
 * synchronization (most of the "heavy lifting" is in this
 * call).  Finally the synchronized "finishDocument" is
 * called to flush changes to the directory.
 *
 * When flush is called by IndexWriter we forcefully idle
 * all threads and flush only once they are all idle.  This
 * means you can call flush with a given thread even while
 * other threads are actively adding/deleting documents.
 *
 *
 * Exceptions:
 *
 * Because this class directly updates in-memory posting
 * lists, and flushes stored fields and term vectors
 * directly to files in the directory, there are certain
 * limited times when an exception can corrupt this state.
 * For example, a disk full while flushing stored fields
 * leaves this file in a corrupt state.  Or, an OOM
 * exception while appending to the in-memory posting lists
 * can corrupt that posting list.  We call such exceptions
 * "aborting exceptions".  In these cases we must call
 * abort() to discard all docs added since the last flush.
 *
 * All other exceptions ("non-aborting exceptions") can
 * still partially update the index structures.  These
 * updates are consistent, but, they represent only a part
 * of the document seen up until the exception was hit.
 * When this happens, we immediately mark the document as
 * deleted so that the document is always atomically ("all
 * or none") added to the index.
