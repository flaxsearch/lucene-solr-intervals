/** File-based {@link Directory} implementation that uses
 *  mmap for reading, and {@link
 *  FSDirectory.FSIndexOutput} for writing.
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE</b>: memory mapping uses up a portion of the
 * virtual memory address space in your process equal to the
 * size of the file being mapped.  Before using this class,
 * be sure your have plenty of virtual address space, e.g. by
 * using a 64 bit JRE, or a 32 bit JRE with indexes that are
 * guaranteed to fit within the address space.
 * On 32 bit platforms also consult {@link #MMapDirectory(File, LockFactory, int)}
 * if you have problems with mmap failing because of fragmented
 * address space. If you get an OutOfMemoryException, it is recommended
 * to reduce the chunk size, until it works.
 *
 * <p>Due to <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4724038">
 * this bug</a> in Sun's JRE, MMapDirectory's {@link IndexInput#close}
 * is unable to close the underlying OS file handle.  Only when GC
 * finally collects the underlying objects, which could be quite
 * some time later, will the file handle be closed.
 *
 * <p>This will consume additional transient disk usage: on Windows,
 * attempts to delete or overwrite the files will result in an
 * exception; on other platforms, which typically have a &quot;delete on
 * last close&quot; semantics, while such operations will succeed, the bytes
 * are still consuming space on disk.  For many applications this
 * limitation is not a problem (e.g. if you have plenty of disk space,
 * and you don't rely on overwriting files on Windows) but it's still
 * an important limitation to be aware of.
 *
 * <p>This class supplies the workaround mentioned in the bug report
 * (see {@link #setUseUnmap}), which may fail on
 * non-Sun JVMs. It forcefully unmaps the buffer on close by using
 * an undocumented internal cleanup functionality.
 * {@link #UNMAP_SUPPORTED} is <code>true</code>, if the workaround
 * can be enabled (with no guarantees).
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> Accessing this class either directly or
 * indirectly from a thread while it's interrupted can close the
 * underlying channel immediately if at the same time the thread is
 * blocked on IO. The channel will remain closed and subsequent access
 * to {@link MMapDirectory} will throw a {@link ClosedChannelException}. 
 * </p>
 * @see <a href="http://blog.thetaphi.de/2012/07/use-lucenes-mmapdirectory-on-64bit.html">Blog post about MMapDirectory</a>
