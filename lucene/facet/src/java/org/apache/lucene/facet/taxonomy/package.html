<body>
	<h1>Taxonomy of Categories</h1>
	
	Facets are defined using a hierarchy of categories, known as a
	<i>Taxonomy</i>.
	
	<br>
	For example, in a book store application, a Taxonomy could have the
	following hierarchy:
	<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Author</li>
		<ul>
		<li>Mark Twain</li>
		<li>J. K. Rowling</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Date</li>
		<ul>
		<li>2010</li>
		<li>2009</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	
	The <i>Taxonomy</i> translates category-paths into category-ordinal and vice versa.
